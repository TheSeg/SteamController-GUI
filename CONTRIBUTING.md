# How To Contribute

So you want to contribute to the project. **AWESOME!** This is a tool for
the development community and is open for anyone to use -- and more importantly
contribute to!

This document guides you in how best to contribute. If you're used to Forking and
pull requests on GitHub, this isn't much new. If it is new to you, take a look. It's
common practices that will help you become a better contributor to other open source
projects.

## Issue Tracking
Issues for this project are located on the repository's [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/TheSeg/SteamController-GUI/issues).
If there's a problem or a feature you wish to see with this project, please fill out
an issue. This allows the issue to be tracked and managed.

## How To Contribute Code
GitHub provides a guide on [Forking a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) that covers most of this project. Keep in mind that all pull requests to "gh-pages" will be rejected. Use "master" instead. This allows the master repo to run locally while the official website lives on it's own.

Once you Fork the repository, **create a new branch with the issue number!**
This is a command line example for you to use, but you can replicate this on whatever Git GUI you're using.

```bash
$ git checkout -b issue_####

# ( Explanation: this useful command will:
# "checkout" a "-b" (branch) by the name of "issue_####"
# or create it if it doesn't exist )
```

Once you're finished writing and testing locally your code, commit and send your changes back to your fork on GitHub. From there, you can make a Pull Request to the **master** branch of the project.
